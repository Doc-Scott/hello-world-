# hello-world-
Chemist and educator starting a new career in tech. 
Why? I Found myself mentally unchallenged in the classroom and greatly missed the satisfaction of using my own skills and intellect to create my own work. Not to mention the furstrations of managing teenage behaiour and working in an out dated education system...  
Now I am here learning python and applying it to personal projects 
Personal projects focus on chemical education as not to let my teaching skills and chemical knowledge go to waste
